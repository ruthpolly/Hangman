## User Experience (UX)

Hangman is a game site for anyone searching for a quick word game. Along with some niche categories such as Marvel Heros, there are more general categories such as countries and dog breeds, fo that anyone can play the game. Having multiple categories means more can be added quite easily if necessary.

* To engage users and ensure a pleasurable experience playing the game.

#### First Time Visitor Goals

* To be able to navigate the site easily
* To be able to start and play the game easily.

#### Returning Visitor Goals

* To find old/new recipes to try.
* To find up to date information about gluten/coeliac disease.

## Design

### Colour Scheme

![Hangman Colour Palette]

The website uses pastel colours that are apparent in the hero image and to compliment the colours in other images. The palette was designed by using the [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) website.

### Typography

Google Fonts was used for:

* Bruno Ace is used for headings on the site.

* Raleway is used for the text on the site. 

### Imagery

The images used were all taken from the [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) website.

### Wireframes

The Wireframe was created on [Balsamiq] (https://balsamiq.com/).

[Home Page Wireframe]()

[Game Page Wireframe]()

### Features

The website has two pages, a home page and a games page. The game page is reached when a game is started, and a home button is available on the game page. 

* Both pages on the website have:

  * A footer which contains social media icon links to instagram, facebook, teitter and youtube. 

* Home Page.
  * Main Area.
  The main home page area consists of categories for the user to choose from

* Games page. 
  * Hangman Animation.
  The Games section consists of a blank area on the left where the hangman animation will occur should a user guess a letter wrong.
  * Keyboard.
  This section contains a keyboard that user can choose letters from. The letters will stay highlighted once chosen to avoid clicking the same letter twice.
  * Above the keyboard there is a sections where the spaces for the letters in the word will be displayed. When a letter is guessed correctly, it will be filled in the allocated space.


* Future Implementations.
  * More Games
  More categories and animations would be added with more time, and different levels for people to choose from, and perhaps a childrens section with different styling to appeal to younger people.

### Accessibility

It is important to make websites as accessible as possible. This was achieved by:

* Using semantic HTML.
* Using descriptive alt attributes on links on the site.
* Ensuring that there is a good colour contrast on the site.
* Making menus accessible by ensuring the current page is marked current for screen readers.

### Full Testing

To fully test my website I used several browsers (google chrome, safari, mozilla firefox) and devices (HP laptop, lenovo monitor, iPad Mini, Iphone 11 and iPhone 13).

I checked each page using google chrome developer tools to make sure they were responsive on different screen sizes.

Links.

1. Test every link on the home page. Links all worked as expected and all links leading to an external page opened correctly in a new browser tab.
2. Test every link on the game page. Links all worked as expected and all links leading to an external page opened correctly in a new browser tab.
